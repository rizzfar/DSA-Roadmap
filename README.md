# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms Roadmap

Welcome to my personal journey through **Data Structures and Algorithms**! This repository follows the **Data Structures & Algorithms Roadmap** from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh), providing me with a structured path to master core concepts and improve my problem-solving skills.

## 📚 Why This Repository?

Learning Data Structures and Algorithms is essential for becoming a well-rounded software engineer and improving coding efficiency. This repository is my personal notebook where I’ll:

- Document my learning progress
- Solve related problems
- Track and review concepts as I grow
- Share useful insights and resources

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **/notes**: Notes on each topic with examples and explanations.
- **/problems**: Solutions and code for problems tackled during the learning process.
- **/resources**: Articles, books, and videos that have been helpful.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Languages

I’ll be primarily using **Python** for code examples, as it allows me to focus more on logic than syntax. I may also include solutions in **JavaScript** and **Java** where applicable.

## 🚀 Resources from Roadmap.sh

The roadmap itself is hosted on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) with a fantastic community and guides. It’s a highly recommended resource for anyone interested in mastering DSA.

---

## 📅 Goals

1. Complete the entire roadmap in the next 3-4 months.
2. Build a project or tool using learned algorithms by the end.
3. Solidify understanding to be ready for technical interviews.
